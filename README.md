# Blockchain Data Structure

With my growing interest in the cryptocurrency space and the bitcoin protocol, I decided to take it upon myself to understand the inner workings of a blockchain. Using the following tutorial series on building a blockchain in Java, my academic knowledge of cryptography and the [Bitcoin Whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) itself, I was able to build a simplified local blockchain that utilizes the proof-of-work (PoW) system.
